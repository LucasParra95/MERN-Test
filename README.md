- Send the data through an API and show the API result on the browser console
- Create a public GitHub project
- Create a dev branch from master
- Push the test to the dev

## Back-End:
- Use NodeJs, Express and MongoDB to create a backend server, controllers and routes to manage the data collected and displayed on the Front-End.
- MONGO_URI: mongodb+srv://admin:0881Digital!@interviewtest.bnk5t.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
